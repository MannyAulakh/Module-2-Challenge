# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

The following challenge involved creating a sample portfolio website for a developer. The website is only comprised of HTML and CSS. The website is merely a mockup and will require further development to be published live.

The challenge required the website to feature the following:
-	Name, Avatar, Links to Sections, About, Work Samples, and Contact Info
-	The navigation links scroll to the appropriate section
-	The first work sample should feature a larger image compared to others
-	Responsive layout

The webpage is fully responsive and will fit any screen size. Further, the work samples feature dynamic elements where their respective images expand when hover over. Also, work samples feature a tooltip that pop-up when the user hovers over the name.
